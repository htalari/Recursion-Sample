# Recursion-Sample
This is a project in which the user can add multiple people into an address list. Each user is stored as a node in a linked list. Users can decide how they want their address list displayed, while also choosing how to delete and add new individuals to the list. All linked list methods are solved using recursion where applicable. 

## How to get started 
* run the Driver.class file 
* follow the GUI prompts to decide what you would like to do with your address list
